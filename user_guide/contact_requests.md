# Contact 

## Sending a contact request

To send a contact request to someone, you just have to add them as a contact, either from the contact profile, the Contact section in your profile or from the one to one chat button called "Add to contact".

## Seeing contact requests

The contact requests button appears in the contact colmun just above channel. If there is no contact requests, the button is not shown. The number of requests is shown in the badge.

That list will update when you receive new contact requests in real time or update with past requests when logging in.

You will also get a notification, if it was enabled in the settings (enabled by default), when you receive a new contact request.

In the Contact requests popup, wou will see all your received contact requests.
From there, you can accept or reject requests individually or in bulk.
You can also block a person or see it's profile from the three dots (`...`) button.

## Blocking new contact requests

You can block new contact requests by going in your Profile in the Privacy section.

The "Allow new contact requests" is by default turned on, meaning that you will get new contact requests. If you turn it off, you will no longer receive contact requests from anyone. You can still add contacts and get contacted by your contacts however.

## Blocking contact request notifications

If you still want to receive contact requests, but don't want the notification, you can disable it in your Profile in the Notifications section.
